<h2>Overview:</h2>
I am going to make a memory game.  The idea of the game is that you will have a 4 by 4 grid of card and you would have to pick one card and memorize it and once you do you would click another card.  If it has the same picture then its a match and you get a point, but if its the wrong picture then you would not get a point.  You will win once all card has been faced up and disappear. 
  
I choose this classic game because I really want to impliment the add.event/class methods that we did.  I also think this would be a great starter project for a begginer as myself.
  
  <h2>Game Rules:</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Click the start button for the game to start.</li>
  <li>There will be a grid of 16 cards all face down.</li>
  <li>You can click on one face down card at a time.</li>
  <li>If two card matches then you would get one point and the card would disappear.</li>
  <li>If the set of card does not match it would go back face down.</li>
  <li>Once there is no more card left on the board then the game would be over.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>User Stories</h2>
  <ul>

  </ul>
