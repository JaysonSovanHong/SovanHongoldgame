<h1>Snake</h1>

<h2>Overview:<h2>
I am making the classic snake game.  It will consist of three pages.  On the first page that it will have the start menu which will consist of the start game button, and onced it is clicked the game will load onto the second screen which will have the actual game.  Once you reached 25 points the game will transition into the you 'win screen.'
  
I choose this classic game because I really want to impliment the add.event/class methods that we did.  I also think this would be a great starter project for a begginer as myself.
  
  <h2>Game Rules:</h2>

  <h2>User Stories</h2>
  When you hit the start game button > the game will start.

  <h2> MVP Checklist:</h2>
  The page has to have three container, that would look like a page effect.
  The first container needs a background picture and a start button that will load the game when pressed.
  The second page will have a grid for the snake to move around.
  It needs to have a score counter that logs in everytime the snake eats the apple.
  Snake needs to move in one direction when game start. 
  Snake needs to be able to move across the screen. 
  Apple need to be randomize on the grid for the apple to appear.
  Once the snake eats the apple it needs to dissapear and you need to log in one point.
  Once the point reached 25 it need to fade out to the third DIV and have a You Win screen. 
  The snake needs to be able to had an event listener for when it eats itself or hit the wall as that would be a dislay screen of game over.
